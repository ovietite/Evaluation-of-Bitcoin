Using a Python script and the yfinance library, we acquired Bitcoin price 
data from Yahoo Finance for use in training, testing, and a generalisation 
check. To proceed, we will pre-process the data and conduct exploratory 
analysis (EDA). As a means of making complex data sets more digestible, 
Python Notebook (Jupyter Notebook) is used in the EDA process of data 
visualisation and analysis. NumPy and Pandas are utilised for analytics 
and matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation in data analysis. During data 
pre-processing, we clean and organise our data in preparation for training 
our models. Drop and fill missing values, data transformation (log), 
feature engineering (new features), and feature encoding are all 
pre-processing activities carried out here. Machine learning techniques 
(including k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Ridge Regression, 
XG Boost, Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Long 
Short-Term Memory) are trained and tested on Bitcoin price data in this 
project. The most popular machine learning libraries in Python, 
Scikit-learn and Deep Learning using Keras (Tensor Flow) for ANN, are used 
here. Common metrics used to assess a model's performance include mean 
absolute error and root mean squared error.
